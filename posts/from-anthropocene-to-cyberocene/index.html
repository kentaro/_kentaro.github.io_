Crutzen, has been increasing its importance among not only science world but also philosophy and art world. In the former, the word is referred along with speculative realism. In the latter, it is often referred as a next-generation concept to strategically confuse the boundary between human beings and other things.</p><p>The concept is intriguing not just because it brings a new way of thinking on how human beings have affected the Earth in terms of geology, but because it implies the world after human beings. If human beings could impact the nature geologically or aerologically, things are also able to do so instead of us. That is, for instance, AI can be an alternative to us in the next era.</p><p>We can imagine some intelligence in the world after billions of years would find remainders of ours in cyber garbages. Which would be digital sequences encoded into immediately-unreadable form. The future intelligence, however, would soon extract successions of meanings from them. The sequence would consist of Web pages, just being created as you see, tweets, and digital tokens backed by some blockchain.</p><p>Geological layer in this era is not limited only to physical one. We can regard vast amounts of information encoded into digital data around the Web as a kind of material that “erodes” the shape of “geological” environment same as human activities to the Earth in the current Anthropocene era. Future cyber-archeologists will excavate proofs that indicate the existence of human beings. We are now toward such an era, Cyberocene.</p></div><div class="section bottom-menu"><hr><p><a href=/posts>back</a>
