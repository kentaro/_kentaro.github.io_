It is formed by materials. Preference to collect such physical things features in men’s taste. I don’t have any interest in it, however, it could make me satisfied, though.</p><p>At the beginning, I don’t like to have materials. I rarely buy things. Furniture, clothes, shoes, home appliances, etc. discourage me to buy them, not because they are expensive, but I don’t need them. Thinking of when I will move from the room I’m at now doesn’t urge me to do so. I just don’t want to have materials.</p><p>A few kind of things I buy usually are books and potteries. Books are necessary to my life because I have many topics to think about. If not, I would never buy them. I don’t have any bibliophilic taste. Like it, I just buy potteries because I imagine I use them practically. If not, I wouldn’t buy them.</p><p>You might think that I am an extremely stingy person. I don’t think so. I don’t hesitate to use the money to eat and drink, especially when I have a chance to have delicious food and sake. It’s no exaggeration to say that I spend almost all of my income to have a fun time at dinner.</p><p>At the same time, I’m really intrigued by logical and abstract thought. Such kind of thoughts cover a wider range than empirical and concrete thoughts. Stimulating thoughts seem to anyway enchant me. It’s because I have spent much money to buy books through all my life for tens of years.</p><p>The preference of mine helps me behave as a manager. Management is an art based on highly logical and abstract thoughts. When you see managers do something, you think they work on concrete issues with empirical knowledge. However, what makes managers great is the ability to think logically and abstractly to cover a wider range of the world, I’m convinced.If not, we can’t progress toward the future with firm belief.</p></div><div class="section bottom-menu"><hr><p><a href=/posts>back</a>
